Collection of GUI-based calculator implementations across different programming languages.

## Rules

- **Four Basic Operations**: Must support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Decimal Support**: Must support decimal/floating-point numbers
- **PEMDAS Support**: Should handle PEMDAS rule (e.g., `5 + 3 * 3 = 21`)
- **GUI Required**: No Terminal/console-based calculators, all implementations must have a proper GUI
- **Button-Based Input**: All input must be through clickable buttons (no keyboard input required)
- **Display**: Must have a visual display showing current input and results
- **Built-in Libraries Only**: Only use libraries that come standard with the language installation (no external dependencies)
- **Exception Handling**:
  - Division by zero
  - Invalid operations/syntax errors
  - Overflow errors
- **Clear/Reset Function**: Must include a way to clear the current input or reset the calculator
- **One File Only**: All codes for each programming language must fit in a single file
